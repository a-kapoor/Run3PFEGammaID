The standard GSF electron track reconstruction is triggered by the presence of high energy isolated electromagnetic clusters, but it is not suited for electrons in jets (usually soft and not isolated). Electrons in Jets are usually not the target electrons for analyses within CMS and hence a specialized ID is needed for properly identifying these electrons.
